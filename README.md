# Attendance Marker

## Overview
The **Attendance Marker** Chrome extension automates the attendance marking process by leveraging AI-powered OCR (Google Gemini API). Users can upload an image containing roll numbers, and the extension extracts the numbers, allowing for manual review and modification before marking the corresponding checkboxes on an active attendance webpage. This extension significantly reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and enhances efficiency.
